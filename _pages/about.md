I am truly honored to be a first-year master’s student in Anesthesiology at [Peking University Shenzhen Hospital](https://www.pku.edu.cn) ,under the guidance of my esteemed supervisor, Professor Luo Tao. My research focuses on Microelectrode Array (MEA) and its applications in neural circuit studies—a field I am deeply passionate about and committed to exploring.
